### Restaurant Reviews

You are creating an online review app for your restaurant, "Everything But Fish". Users can post reviews, 
as long as they do not exceed 250 characters and there is no mention of 'fish'.

The `StringValidator` class contains methods to do these checks. Implement the methods contained in `StringValidator`
so that they return successfully if the validation passes, and throw an `InvalidStringException` if the validation 
fails.

Make use of constants for the word that is unmentionable and the maximum length of the reviews.
